## More information about each site

#### Facebook

Facebook uses a city to look around as it is not international, you can find the id by looking for your city on facebook and copy the id of their page.
(usually facebook.com/..../place/id)

Facebook is a good website for scraping.

#### Kijiji

Kijiji is a good website for scraping

#### Ebay

Ebay is an okay website for scraping
.
#### Amazon

Since Amazon is a vast website, it is way harder to find new ads and to precise what we want, therefore you will most likely get garbage from it than what you're actually looking.
It could be fine if you're looking for the cheapest price for a "popular" item

Amazon is a bad website for scraping

#### Lespacs

Lespacs is just like kijiji except it is more Quebec centered than Canada, therefore it can be a bad site for scraping if you are not from Quebec, otherwise it is a pretty good one

Outside of Quebec: Lespacs is a bad website for scraping

Inside of Quebec: Lespacs is a good website for scraping
